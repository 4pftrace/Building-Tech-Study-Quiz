## Building Tech Study Quiz

This repository now includes a fully self-contained HTML quiz experience generated from the original study guide script.

### How to update the quiz

1. Ensure you have Python 3 available.
2. Run the generator script from the repository root:
   ```bash
   python Quiz
   ```
   This recreates `index.html` with the latest set of randomized questions and any embedded imagery that is available on the system.

### Viewing the quiz

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to take the interactive quiz. No build step or external dependencies are required.
